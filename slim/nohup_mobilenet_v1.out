WARNING:tensorflow:From train_image_classifier.py:490: softmax_cross_entropy (from tensorflow.contrib.losses.python.losses.loss_ops) is deprecated and will be removed after 2016-12-30.
Instructions for updating:
Use tf.losses.softmax_cross_entropy instead. Note that the order of the logits and labels arguments has been changed.

Instructions for updating:

Future major versions of TensorFlow will allow gradients to flow
into the labels input on backprop by default.

See `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2`.
